    detailedDescription: "Manual Therapy involves skilled hand movements and skilled passive movements of joints and soft tissue. Our specialists are trained in advanced techniques such as joint mobilization, manipulation, and myofascial release. \n\nThis hands-on approach is designed to induce relaxation, increase range of motion, and reduce pain. \n\nIt is particularly beneficial for stiff joints, frozen shoulder, neck pain, and back issues. We believe in the power of touch to heal and restore mechanical function to the body.",

    description: "Specialized technique using thin needles to release muscle knots and treat chronic pain.",
    detailedDescription: "Dry Needling is a specialized technique that uses thin monofilament needles to treat trigger points—knots in the muscle that cause pain and dysfunction. \n\nUnlike acupuncture, which focuses on energy flow, dry needling is based on Western anatomical and neurophysiological principles. \n\nIt effectively releases muscle tension, reduces pain signals, and promotes biochemical healing. It is highly effective for chronic pain syndromes, tension headaches, and overuse injuries.",

    title: "Cupping Therapy",
    description: "Ancient therapeutic technique using suction cups to improve blood flow and relieve muscle tension.",
    detailedDescription: "Cupping therapy is an ancient form of alternative medicine in which a therapist puts special cups on your skin for a few minutes to create suction. \n\nWe use it to help with pain, inflammation, blood flow, relaxation and well-being, and as a type of deep-tissue massage. \n\nThe suction and negative pressure provided by cupping can loosen muscles, encourage blood flow, and sedate the nervous system (which makes it an excellent treatment for high blood pressure).",
